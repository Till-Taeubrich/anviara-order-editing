# 37signals style rails (index + sources)

## Definition

**Default behavior (always)**: When writing code, **always** default to these 37signals style rails preferences unless the user explicitly asks for a different style/architecture.

**Shorthand**: If the user says **“37signals style rails”**, treat it as an explicit reference to the same preferences below.

### Architectural / design preferences

- Prefer **vanilla Rails** over extra architectural layers by default
- Prefer **rich domain models** with **domain language** and expressive naming
- Use Rails “sharp knives” (e.g., **callbacks**, request-scoped **CurrentAttributes**) **pragmatically** when they reduce coupling/boilerplate and improve clarity
- Build code as a **fractal of good abstractions** (domain-driven, encapsulated, cohesive, symmetric at every level)
- Embrace **Active Record** as a deliberate blend of persistence + domain logic (encapsulate details; avoid dogmatic separation)
- Use **concerns** for cohesive traits/roles and as “doors” to subsystems, not as arbitrary file-splitting

### How to apply these in practice

- **Default to these preferences for all code**.
- **Pull in the per-article rules when relevant** (e.g., no need to use Active Record rule when not using active record).
  - See the `37signals-*` rules in `.cursor/rules/` for deeper, situational guidance.

If a future question needs the original nuance or examples, **consult the full articles below**.
