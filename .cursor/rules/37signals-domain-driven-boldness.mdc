# 37signals: Domain driven boldness

Reference index: `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`

## Architectural / design rules

- **Don’t be aseptic; double down on boldness**:
  - Prefer vivid, domain-specific names that convey the concept precisely (often more memorable than generic CRUD vocabulary).
- **Model domain concepts as first-class code**:
  - Represent “what the system is” in the language of the domain (entities, roles, states, and operations).
- **Use naming to encode meaning and constraints**:
  - A name like “petition” vs “request” carries policy/intent; use that to make domain rules self-evident.
- **Use role-like modularization when it clarifies the domain**:
  - Concerns (or similar composition) can express domain roles (“Examiner”, “Petitioner”) when they form cohesive units.
- **Write plain-text domain descriptions first**:
  - Use a short written description as a thinking tool to shape the domain model before or while coding.

## Default stance in this codebase

When the user says **“37signals style rails”**, these rules apply (see `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`).
