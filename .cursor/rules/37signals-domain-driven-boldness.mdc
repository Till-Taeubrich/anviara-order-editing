# 37signals: Domain driven boldness

Reference index: `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`

## Architectural / design rules

- **Don't be aseptic; double down on boldness**:
  - Prefer vivid, domain-specific names that convey the concept precisely (often more memorable than generic CRUD vocabulary).

  ```ruby
  # Bold: the method name "decease" captures the domain concept precisely
  module Person::Tombstonable
    def decease
      case
      when deceasable?
        erect_tombstone
        remove_administratorships
        remove_accesses_later
        self
      when deceased?
        nil
      else
        raise ArgumentError, "an account owner cannot be removed. " \
                             "You must transfer ownership first"
      end
    end
  end
  ```

- **Model domain concepts as first-class code**:
  - Represent "what the system is" in the language of the domain (entities, roles, states, and operations).

- **Use naming to encode meaning and constraints**:
  - A name like "petition" vs "request" carries policy/intent; use that to make domain rules self-evident.

- **Use role-like modularization when it clarifies the domain**:
  - Concerns (or similar composition) can express domain roles ("Examiner", "Petitioner") when they form cohesive units.

- **Write plain-text domain descriptions first**:
  - Use a short written description as a thinking tool to shape the domain model before or while coding.

## Default stance in this codebase

When the user says **"37signals style rails"**, these rules apply (see `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`).
