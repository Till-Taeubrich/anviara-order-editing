# 37signals: Fractal journeys

Reference index: `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`

## Architectural / design rules

- **Good code is a fractal**: you should see the same good qualities repeated at every level of abstraction (subsystem → class → method).
- **Be domain-driven at every level**:
  - Names and APIs should reflect the problem domain, not incidental implementation detail.
- **Encapsulate aggressively**:
  - Expose crisp public methods; hide internal details behind private helpers/objects.
- **Be cohesive**:
  - Each abstraction should “do one thing” from the caller’s point of view (orchestrate at a high level; delegate details below).
- **Be symmetric / stay at one level of abstraction**:
  - Avoid mixing low-level detail into high-level orchestration.
  - Prefer parallel structure (e.g., “relay” and “revoke” counterparts) so the reader can follow the journey cleanly.

## Default stance in this codebase

When the user says **“37signals style rails”**, these rules apply (see `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`).
