# Develop a kickass spec for a new feature

You will receive requirements for a new feature and develop a great spec for it through iterative refinement.

## Steps

### 1. Clarify the requirements

First, evaluate whether the requirements need any clarification. If they do, ask the user before proceeding.

Unless the requirements are extremely clear upfront, you should always ask at least 3 clarifying questions - ideally, select the ones which are most likely to reduce ambiguity and result in a great spec, and, later, a great, tight implementation that does what it needs to do and nothing more.

### 2. Research the codebase

Once you are happy with the basic requirements, use SemanticSearch and Read to understand existing patterns, conventions, and related code in the codebase. Identify abstractions that should be reused.

### 3. First iteration of the spec

Create a first iteration of the spec based on the requirements and your codebase research.

The first iteration will likely be bloated and overly complex. That's okay, it's a first draft.

### 4. Refine the spec

Review the first iteration against DHH's principles:
- Is this the simplest approach that could work?
- Does it follow Rails conventions and existing codebase patterns?
- Are we building only what's needed, nothing more?
- Do names reflect the business domain clearly?

Write down specific critiques and improvements needed.

### 5. Second iteration of the spec

Apply the refinements to create a second, tighter iteration of the spec.

### 6. Refine the spec again

Repeat the DHH review process for the second iteration.

### 7. Third iteration of the spec

Apply the second round of refinements to create the final spec.

### 8. Pause and notify the user that the spec is ready for review

The user will want to review the spec in detail before proceeding to implementation.

In your notification, summarise the key, final components of the spec at a very high level (3 paragraphs max), and also summarise the key changes that were made through refinement (also 3 paragraphs max). Use paragraphs rather than bulletpoints.

### 9. Afterwards: build the feature

Implement the feature following the spec.

Review your own code output to ensure it has not deviated substantially from the spec without good cause.

### 10. After user confirmation: Write tests
Only after the user confirms the feature is complete and no further changes are expected, write RSpec tests to verify the functionality works as expected, and run them to ensure they pass.
