# 37signals: Good concerns

Reference index: `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`

## Architectural / design rules

## Placement conventions

- **Default use-case**: concerns are primarily used to organize **one host model’s** cohesive traits/roles (not as grab-bag shared modules).
- **Common model concerns**: put in `app/models/concerns`.
- **Model-specific concerns**: put in `app/models/<model_name>/...` and include without repeating namespaces.
- **Controller concerns**: place most in `app/controllers/concerns`, with subsystem-specific subfolders as needed.

## What belongs in a concern

- **Concerns should be cohesive traits/roles**:
  - A concern should reflect “has trait” / “acts as” semantics.
  - Don’t use concerns as arbitrary buckets just to split a large file.
- **Concerns improve readability when used to manage complexity**:
  - Split by coherent concepts so the reader can focus on one thing at a time.
- **Concerns can be domain-oriented abstractions**:
  - Names should capture domain roles and concepts clearly.

## Concerns are not a replacement for OO design

- **Use concerns to offer a nice domain API, but hide subsystems behind it**:
  - A concern can provide the public “door” method(s) while delegating to POROs / composed objects for the heavy work.
- **Avoid “fat and flat” models as the endgame**:
  - Concerns should work alongside composition/inheritance/patterns, not excuse poor responsibility distribution.

## Default stance in this codebase

When the user says **“37signals style rails”**, these rules apply (see `.cursor/rules/37signals-style-rails-index.mdc`).
