# Shopify webhook topics reference

When questions arise about **available webhook topics**, **webhook topic names**, **webhook topic formats**, or **what webhook topics exist**, **always research** the official Shopify webhook topics documentation.

## Research source

**Primary reference**: [Shopify Webhooks API - List of topics](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/webhooks/latest#list-of-topics)

This documentation contains the complete, up-to-date list of all available webhook topics that can be subscribed to.

## When to use this rule

Use this rule and research the documentation when:

- User asks "what webhook topics are available?"
- User asks "what's the topic name for [event]?"
- User needs to know the canonical topic format (e.g., `products/update`, `orders/create`)
- User is unsure about topic naming conventions
- User wants to know if a specific webhook topic exists
- User asks about webhook topic structure or format

## Research approach

1. **Search the web** for the latest Shopify webhook topics documentation
2. **Reference the official documentation** at `https://shopify.dev/docs/api/webhooks/latest#list-of-topics`
3. **Provide accurate topic names** in the canonical format (e.g., `products/update`, not `product/update`)
4. **Cite the documentation** when providing topic information

## Topic format conventions

Webhook topics follow the pattern: `{resource}/{action}` format:

- `products/update` - Product updated
- `products/create` - Product created
- `products/delete` - Product deleted
- `orders/create` - Order created
- `customers/update` - Customer updated
- etc.

Always use the exact topic format as documented in the official Shopify API documentation.
